### Person Properties
#### Name
  - The name of person to be recorded in the SectresBook.
  - Identified by prefix `name`.
  - This is a valid property to find a person by using the `find` command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
It is recommended to include the full name of the person to avoid ambiguities during operations.
</div>

#### Phone
  - The phone number of the person to be recorded in the SectresBook.
  - Identified by the prefix `phone`.
  - This is a valid property to find a person by using the `find` command.
  - A phone number should contain only numbers and be at least 3 digits long.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Ensure that no two persons have the same phone number!
</div>

#### Email
  - The email address of the person to be recorded in the SectresBook.
  - Identified by the prefix `email`.
  - Serves mainly as a point of information relating the person.
  - Emails should be of the format `local-part@domain` and adhere to the following constraints:
    1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters `_` and `.`. The local-part may not start or end with any special characters
    2. This is followed by a `@` and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods. The domain name must:
       + end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
       + have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
       + have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

#### Address
  - The residing address of the person.
  - Identified by the prefix `home`.
  - Serves mainly as a point of information relating to the person.
  - There is no constraint on how the home address of a person should be written, as long as it is sufficiently understandable.

#### Loan
  - The amount of money that is owed by a person, or is to be paid to that person.
  - Identified by the prefix `loan`.
  - A loan amount can be either negative, positive or zero.
    + A positive value indicates an amount that the person has yet to pay to the organisation.
    + A zero value indicates no outstanding loan.
    + A negative value indicates an amount that should be paid back to the person.
  - Loans can only take up numerical values.

#### Loan History
  - A loan history is a subset of the loans properties that describes the changes to the numeric values of the loans in detail.

  - Consists of the following:
    - Current loan value
    - Change in amount from last value
    - Reason for change

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Including a reason for every change to a person's loan value reduces the risk of accidentally adding an incorrect amount to someone. It keeps a detail tab of every increment and decrement in value.
</div>

  - Identified by the prefix `bday`.
  - Serves as a point of information for a person.
  - This must be a valid date form `DD/MM/YYYY`.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add name/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add name/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as `name/John Doe tag/friend` or as `name/John Doe`.

* `<OR>` signifies an exclusive-or parameter that is to be input.<br>
  e.g `INDEX <OR> NAME` allows either the parameter `INDEX` or the parameter `NAME`, but not both

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[tag/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/friend`, `tag/friend tag/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `name/NAME phone/PHONE_NUMBER`, `phone/PHONE_NUMBER name/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `phone/12341234 phone/56785678`, only `phone/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
