## User Interface

Here is an overview of the User Interface (UI) components.

The UI comprises four sections:
![UILabeled](images/UiLabeled.png)

### Command Box

SectresBook is a CLI app, type your command inputs here! For more information on command inputs, refer to [Features](#features) below.

Once the command box is selected, a results display will appear to report the messages from the program to you. Error messages and success messages will be shown in this box. Click anywhere else on the screen, or press the `ESC` key to exit out of the command box and hide the results display.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You may activate the command box by simply pressing the spacebar on your keyboard. There is no need to use your mouse to click on the bar.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Similarly, you may press the `ESC` key on your keyboard to exit out of the command box and hide the results display.
</div>

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

### People Panel

This panel contains all the club and organisation members you have registered in this book. They are laid out horizontally. Although there is no need to physically control list, the user may still scroll the list with their mouse, or by pressing on the horizontal scroll bar and scrolling.

Each card representing the information of a person displays the name, phone number and total present loan amount, which may be positive to indicate an amount owed by the person, or negative to indicate an amount due to be paid to the person.

The index of the person is only an ordering within the current displayed list, it **is not tied** to the person itself.

Check the [Person Features](#person-features) to learn more about the commands you can execute related to people.

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

### Inspect Panel

This panel is related to the people panel and shows the relevant basic information of the currently inspected person. A person can be inspect by either pressing his or her card, or by typing the `inspect` command. More details on the `inspect` command can be found [here](#inspecting-a-person--inspect).

The left side shows the basic information while the right side shows the history of loan transactions recorded.

Note that the icon of the hand holding coins shows the most recent transaction and earlier transactions are listed in order below.

The total amount of the loans is also stated in the bottom right of this panel, describing in fuller detail if the sum is owed by or to be paid to the person.

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

### Notes Panel

This panel stores all the information related to notes and tasks that the user may want to keep track of.

Each note contains an index, a title, contents and tags.

The index of the notes is only an ordering within the current displayed list, it **is not tied** to the note itself.

Both the people and notes panels share a pool of tags for easier referencing on which group of people may be related to a specific note.

Check the [Notes Features](#note-features) to learn more about the commands you can execute related to notes.

## Properties

### Person Properties

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/TypicalPersonCard.png">
</p>
<center style="font-size:3mm;">A typical person card.</center>

#### Name

The name of a person to be recorded in the SectresBook. Two persons cannot have exactly the same name, but slight deviations are acceptable. Our team realises that many people may share the same name, so it is alright to use close aliases.

This property can be identified from the GUI by the icon of the silhouette of a person.

<img src="images/icons/person.png" width="50" height="50">

- Identified by the prefix `name`.
- This is a valid property to find a person by using the `find` command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
It is recommended to include the full name of the person instead of aliases for easier searching.
</div>

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

#### Phone
This is phone number of the person to be recorded in the SectresBook. This is a valid property to find a person by using the [`find` command](#locating-persons-by-name-or-contact-number-find).

This property can be identified from the GUI by the icon of a mobile phone.

<img src="images/icons/phone.png" width="50" height="50">

- Identified by the prefix `phone`.
- A phone number should contain only numbers and be at least 3 digits long.

Please record only the most accessible phone number you can contact the given member by. You are not allowed to enter multiple phone numbers in this field.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Ensure that no two persons have the same phone number! This is allowed in the program, but you may have difficulties contacting the person you want in the future.
</div>

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

#### Email

This pertains to the email address of the person to be recorded in the SectresBook. It serves mainly as a point of information regarding the person, but has no additional features tied to it.

This property can be identified from the GUI by the icon of an envelope.

<img src="images/icons/mail.png" width="50" height="50">

- Identified by the prefix `email`.
- Emails should be of the format `local-part@domain` and adhere to the following constraints:

 Part    | Constraint |
|---------|----------|
 Local part |                                                                              The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters `_`, `.`, `+` and `-`. <br><br>The local-part may not start or end with any special characters and special characters may not be adjacent to each other.
 Domain name |The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods. The domain name must:<p> - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long <br>- have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters <br> - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

The local part and domain part **must** be connected by a `@` symbol.

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

#### Address
This is the residing address of the person. It serves mainly as a point of information regarding the person, but has no additional features tied to it.

This property can be identified from the GUI by the icon of a house.

<img src="images/icons/home.png" width="50" height="50">

- Identified by the prefix `home`.
- There is no constraint on how the home address of a person should be written, as long as it is sufficiently understandable.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
Although there is no constraint, please ensure that your screen can accommodate the length of the text. If you find the text being cut off and ellipses `...` showing, please increase either the width or height of your screen.
</div>


[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

#### Loan
This is amount of money that is owed by a person, or is to be paid to that person. This is a property that cannot be manipulated directly, but can only be edited with the [`editLoan` command](#editing-loan-of-a-person-editloan).

This property can be identified from the GUI by the icon of the hand holding two stacks of coins.

<img src="images/icons/loan.png" width="50" height="50">

- A loan amount can be either negative, positive or zero.
    + A positive value indicates an amount that the person has yet to pay to the organisation.
    + A zero value indicates no outstanding loan.
    + A negative value indicates an amount that should be paid back to the person.
- Loans can only take up numerical values.
- The maximum value this property can take is `$1,000,000,000,000.00` (1 trillion dollars ). Similarly, the minimum value is `-$1,000,000,000,000.00` (negative 1 trillion dollars). This should be more than sufficient for general purpose use.

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

#### Loan History
A loan history is linked to the loans properties and describes the changes to the numeric values of the loans in detail.

This property is represented in a descending list on the right side of the inspection panel.

![img.png](images/LoanHistoryPanel.png)

The most recent transaction is recorded at the top, on the row next to the loans icon.

The upwards point red arrow signifies an amount loaned to this member in a transaction.

<img src="images/icons/increase_arrow.png" width="50" height="50">

The downwards pointing green arrow signifies an amount that this member has paid back in a transaction.

<img src="images/icons/decrease_arrow.png" width="50" height="50">

- Consists of the following sub-properties:
    - Current loan value
    - Change in amount from last value
    - Reason for change

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Including a reason for every change to a person's loan value reduces the risk of accidentally adding an incorrect amount to someone. It keeps a detail tab of every increment and decrement in value.
</div>

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

#### Birthday
The birthday date of the person.

This property can be identified from the GUI by the icon of a birthday cake.

<img src="images/icons/birthday.png" width="50" height="50">

- Identified by the prefix `bday`.
- Serves as a point of information for a person.
- This must be a valid date in the form `dd/MM/yyyy`.

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

#### Tags
- Persons can be linked to tag objects, which serve as markers that draw connections between different people as well as associated notes.

This property can be identified from the GUI by tag shaped labels with text inside them. They are usually located at the bottom right of each person card. If there is no such label, then it means this person has no associated tags.

![img.png](images/PersonTags.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Please refer to the [`Tag Properties`](#tag-properties) below for more information regarding tags.
</div>

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

### Notes Properties

  <img src="images/TypicalNoteCard.png">
</p>
<center style="font-size:3mm;">A typical note card.</center>

It is the first line of a note card, which is bigger than the rest of the text.

- This property is identified by the prefix `title`.
- Notes can be filtered through with the `find` command using the title property.
- Titles must be within 100 characters and can contain any ASCII characters.

- This property is identified by `content`.
- This property cannot be left empty.

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

#### Tags

Notes can be linked to tag objects, which serve as markers that draw connections between different people as well as associated notes. Tags can only be alphanumeric.

This is located at the bottom right of the notes card. If there is no such label, then it means this person has no associated tags.

![img.png](images/NoteTags.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Choose short, identifiable tag names.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Please refer to the [`Tag Properties`](#tag-properties) section below for more information regarding tags.
</div>

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add name/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add name/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as `name/John Doe tag/friend` or as `name/John Doe`.

* `<OR>` signifies an exclusive-or parameter that is to be input.<br>
  e.g `INDEX <OR> NAME` allows either the parameter `INDEX` or the parameter `NAME`, but not both

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[tag/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/friend`, `tag/friend tag/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `name/NAME phone/PHONE_NUMBER`, `phone/PHONE_NUMBER name/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `phone/12341234 phone/56785678`, only `phone/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

#### Editing loan of a person : `editLoan`

Edits an existing club member's loan amount in the SectresBook. Please note that the value must be either positive or negative values with up to 2 decimal places.

The absolute maximum amount for a loan is `$1,000,000,000,000.00` (positive or negative 1 trillion). If you are intending to file more than a trillion dollars in total transactions, this application may not be a suitable one for you, as our expected clients do not normally transfer this much money.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If the total amount after the `editLoan` command adds up to more than a trillion, the program will block the command from going through.
</div>


Format: `editLoan INDEX <OR> NAME amt/VALUE reason/REASON`

* Edits the loan value of the existing person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1,2,3 …​
* The `VALUE` can be a positive or negative value with up to 2 decimal places.
* The `VALUE` may not contain delimiters to separate digits, i.e. `$1,000,000` must be expressed as `$1000000` in the program.
* The loan value will be changed by the value given i.e current loan + `VALUE`.

Examples:

* `editLoan 2 amt/30 reason/bought logistics`
* `editLoan alex amt/-30 reason/return money from logistics`
* `list` followed by `editLoan 1 -20 return money` will edit the 1st person in the SectresBook,
  reducing their loan by $20 and saving the `REASON` as `return money`.

#### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the SectresBook. Delete commands are irreversible, so please ensure that you are deleting the correct person.

Format: `delete INDEX <OR> NAME`


* Deleting by **INDEX**:
    * Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
    * The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
    * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​


* Deleting by **NAME**:
    * Delete the entry of the person by name with the given keyword, only if the keywords specified are unique to that person's name.
    * Will not perform any operation if the name of the person does not exist.
    * If the SectresBook contains more than one person that can be found by the keyword specified, the delete command will not execute but will return a list of all people with the given name. From here, you may choose to delete by index.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the SectresBook.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.
* `delete Betsy` deletes the entry belonging to Betsy in the SectresBook
* `delete Lynette` does not perform any operation, as Lynette does not exist in the SectresBook.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
To delete everyone at the same time, please refer to the [`clear` command](#clearing-all-entries--clear).
</div>

#### Adding Notes : `addNote`

Adds a note to the SectresBook.

Format: `addNote title/TITLE content/CONTENT [tag/TAG]... `

#### Locating a note by title : `findNote`

Finds the notes whose titles match any of the given keywords. A filtered icon will show to the side of the Notes Panel to indicate that you are now viewing a filtered list.

<img src="images/NotesFilteredIcon.png" width="256">

Format: `findNote KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `meeting` will match `Meeting`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Meeting Club` will match `Club Meeting`
* Only the title is searched.
* Only the full words will be matched. e.g. `Meetings` will not match `Meeting`
* Keyword cannot contain special characters. However, numbers will be allowed.
* e.g. The keywords `?!` and `t-shirt` will not be allowed.
* e.g. `2` will match `shirt 2` but will not match `shirt2`
* Keywords will ignore special characters.
* e.g. `Meetings` will match `Meetings!!!` and `Meetings 1`
* e.g. `shirt` will match `t-shirt`
* However, `tshirt` will not match `t–shirt` as special characters are ignored (`t-shirt` is now treated as two words, `t` and `shirt` with the special character `-` being treated as a spacing)

Examples:
* `findNote Meeting` returns `Club Meeting`, `Meeting!` and `Meeting 2`
* `findNote Soon` returns `Payment (soon)`

[Back to Top](#sectresbook)

## FAQ

**Q** I work in a highly classified/important organisation and we have large volumes of monetary transactions and tasks we need to keep track of. Can we use this version of the program to manage our operations?<br>
**A** No, the current version of _SectresBook_ is not designed for such intensive and critical operations. It does not support any form of encryption or security and its performance has not been tested rigorously against larger loads. We ***do not suggest*** using this program in places where information loss or leaks may result in catastrophic consequences.

**Q** I cannot see any images in this document, what is wrong?<br>
**A** You are likely viewing the document in dark mode. The images are in black as their main color, please view this document in light mode instead.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous SectresBook home folder.

**Q**: Double-clicking the jar file does not open the jar file, why does this happen?<br>
**A**: Make sure that Java 11 is installed on your computer. You may also open the terminal or command prompt and type `java -jar SectresBook.jar`.

**Q** Do I need to have Java installed to run SectresBook?<br>
**A** Yes, SectresBook runs on Java and would require it to work. For more information on how to install Java 11, visit this [website](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html).

**Q** What can I can do if the window size is too small?<br>
**A** Drag the window of the application with your mouse to enlarge it, or simply click the top right maximise icon of the window.

**Q** Why can't I see the full address of the person I am inspecting?<br>
**A** Your window is too small to accommodate the full label text, please drag your window either wider or taller so that the text may have space to display.

**Q** I have entered a command, but there is no response from the program, why did this happen?<br>
**A** A critical error may have occurred. You may likely be able to continue your usage of the program. Please review your terminal output and file a bug report on our [issues page](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/issues), detailing a description of the bug as well as the steps to reproduce, attaching screenshots if any.

**Q** Do I require an internet connection to use SectresBook?<br>
**A** No, SectresBook fully works without the need for internet connection.

**Q** I have an existing data file but the app does not show any of the information, what is wrong?<br>
**A** Your data file is corrupted. Please open the json data file in a text editor and remove the offending data.

**Q** Who can I contact for questions regarding this version of the program if the information I need cannot be found in this guide?<br>
**A** Please contact the person from whom you obtained this present version from, or contact any of our developers (links to Github):
